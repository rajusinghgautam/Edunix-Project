Python Project: Survival Duration Calculator
I created a class-based "Duration of Survival Calculator" that converts a user's age into different time units (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds). The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the time unit. The main challenge was ensuring accurate calculations for weeks and days, which required accounting for leap years to avoid inaccuracies in the conversion methods, thereby providing precise duration outputs.
